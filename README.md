### Hello/你好/ 👋

没有什么问题是通过增加中间层无法解决的，如果有，那就加两层。
但是我和你之间的唯一障碍，是无法通过中间层弥补的，因为那便是不同的文化与语言。

There is no problem that cannot be solved by adding an intermediate layer. If there is, add two layers.
But the only obstacle between me and you cannot be made up through the middle layer, because that is a different culture and language.
